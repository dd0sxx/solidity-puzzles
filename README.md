# toy-problems

Each toy-problem is given a difficulty scale between 1-10 (10 being most difficult) and should take no longer than 30 minutes to complete.

The point of the toy problems is not for students to write code and get the answer right necessarily, but more to look at code and try to find the answer. Ultimately we want to expand the student's arsenal and expand their knowledge of what to look for and how to spot bugs and vulnerabilites, and optimizations.
